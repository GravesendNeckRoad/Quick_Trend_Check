This is a quick script I wrote for work, which compiles some raw sales data into a time-series chart, to compare a couple of trends.

To provide a bit more background, a client decided on a new pricing strategy for their e-commerce business. We agreed to let it run for a week, monitor the progress, and modify our approach as appropriate. 

Our business is highly seasonal, with very strong correlation across all years, so I compared against the previous year to gauge performance of the new strategy. As was instantly evident, our daily revenue dropped off as soon as we enabled the new strategy. I reported these findings to my manager.

*In order to protect the privacy of our clients, I shall not delve into the specifics of the aforementioned pricing strategy. The data has also been cleaned to protect any customer or otherwise confidential information. 

*The chart is located in the repository as a .jpg file so that you can have a glance without running the code.
